Classic Wordle game, but implemented a score system where users are assigned words of varying levels of difficulty depending on their score. Incorporated an analysis feature that reports back about the percentage of words users got correct for each level of difficulty. This program is designed to help users understand their knowledge of the English vocabulary and practice on a wordle-like game fit for their skill-level.
